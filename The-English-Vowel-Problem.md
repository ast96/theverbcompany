# The English Vowel Problem

- It turns out that English phonics can be partitioned in two groups: those that are very regular, and those that are not.
- The regular group includes all consonant graphemes except those involving C or G.
- The irregular group involves the vowels A, E, I, O and U, plus C and G.
