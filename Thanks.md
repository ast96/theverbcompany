# Acknowledgements

I have received invaluable help during this process from various individuals.  They may not agree with the final result, and any remaining errors are my own:

- I wish to thank Brenda Rapp and Mike McCloskey (professors working on reading research at Johns Hopkins), as well as Ineke van de Craats (Professor Emerita in Holland working on reading by immigrants),  for insightful comments and discussions.

- Without the encouragement and input of my collaborator on many projects, Martha Young-Scholten (Professor at Newcastle University, England) this project would not have taken off -- thanks, Martha!

- From the teaching angle, I wish to thank my teacher friends Sally K. Levison (preschool) and Cami Muonio (M.A. in Special Education) for invaluable comments and insights that they might not always even be aware of having provided.  Also, Sally's stories form the basis of the lessons -- thanks, Sally!

- Thanks to the audience of my informal Brown Bag presentation at Johns Hopkins, in April 2014, for feedback

- Many thanks also to the my technical gurus, I. and A. Thomas!  Also thanks to P. Brattico for useful comments on the website.
