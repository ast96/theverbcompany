## The Verb Company

For the last few years I have been working on the question of how adults (in particular, immigrants) might learn to read English. After finding out that there doesn't exist a straightforward set of spelling rules or generalizations for English, I set out to create one, using Bell (2004) *Understanding English Spelling* and her 72 spelling tables as a starting point.  The 43 rules I developed for single-syllable words in English are different from those in the existing literature.  

I then decided to turn the rules into a format that could be used to teach reading -- and **The Verb Company** was born! The product for adults and older children, **Up the Ladder**, consists of the planned 8 parts, 5 of which would be based on the 43 rules, and the last three deal with longer words (which tend to be more regular than the short words).
