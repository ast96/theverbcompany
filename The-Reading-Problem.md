# The Reading Problem

## Statistics on Reading in the U.S.

### [Adults](nces.ed.gov/NAAL)

- The United States has **11 million non-literate adults**
- Only **15% of the adult population** are “proficient” in reading!

*Note: However, Ravitch (2016) points out that the level of "proficiency" in these tests is very high. The 2016 second edition of Ravitch's riveting book on the American school system  makes a convincing case that while it is often claimed that the reading and math scores have been better and have recently gotten worse, this is not true — rather, there has been improvement over time. Closing schools, opening charter schools, and hiring young inexperienced teachers are not the solution, but it would be better to invest in improving teacher training, the existing schools, etc.*

### [Children](nationsreportcard.gov)

- According to Fortune (Jan.1,  2016 issue), the U.S. spends more money per student on education than most other countries, yet it only **ranks mediocre** in terms of reading (and math) internationally
- The latest results (released Oct. 28th, 2015) show that -- **despite intense efforts by educators and legislators in recent years, including closing many old schools and opening new ones**  -- the **average reading score** for 4th-graders has gone up **only 6 points** (217 to 223), while **math** has gone **up 27 points**, since testing began. A similar pattern holds for 8th-graders. **Alarmingly, the reading score for 8th-graders went down 3 points (to 265) from 2013**; in 1992, it was 260.  The new 8th-grade results cannot be accounted for by data from any particular subgroup -- it is a general pattern.
- Only **60%** of 4th-graders were “**fluent**” in the 2002 oral reading study (but **only 40%** of African-American 4th-graders were fluent)
- According to the [Simplified Spelling Society](spellingsociety.org), it takes **three additional years for children to learn to read English**, compared to more transparent alphabetic languages (such as Finnish or Spanish)

### [International](nces.ed.gov)

- The international PISA reading test for 15-year-olds (2012): U.S. at the **OECD average** 
- U.S. scores have a slight **downward trend** since 2000 
- This does not seem very impressive given the funds and effort that has gone into improving reading in the U.S.
