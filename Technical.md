# A Technical/Theoretical Description of **Up the Ladder**

**Up the Ladder** is a linguistically informed product is based on a phonemic/phonics approach to reading, using a new set of 43 spelling generalizations developed in a 57-page paper (*English reading and spelling rules for short words*, Vainikka 2013).  An example rule: "*Rule 4: The graphemes [...] CK, NG, PH, and SH are uniform*", where 'uniform' means always read the same way, at least in single-syllable words.  The ordering of the generalizations matters, since many of them involve the 'Elsewhere Principle', common in theoretical phonology (that is, one or two special subrules are given first, and all the rest involve a default generalization). 

*Note: For many written words in English, reading them is slightly easier than knowing how to write them (see Bell 2004 for an extensive analysis of the two) -- here we concentrate on reading rather than writing.*

The product is intended to include 8 parts (5-8 forthcoming), each containing 10 video lessons. Typically, 3-4 teaching lessons are followed by a short review/exercise lesson. The first 5 parts would teach the student to read all the common monosyllabic words of English, and the remaining parts would move on to longer words (which tend to be more regular than short words).  The first 2 parts deal only with regular consonants (with only a single version of each of the vowels AEIOU) -- calculating from Berndt et al. (1987, Appendix B), **76% of English** graphemes involving only **consonants** are predictable, while the comparable figure for **vowels is 31%**  -- and the 3rd part deals with regular endings (of monosyllabic words).  The very exceptional consonants C and G are introduced late, as is the silent E.

The first three parts thus provide a solid basis for reading, basically without exceptions and with very few sight words. Parts 1-3 cover 2106 single-syllable words of English; **98% of them are spelled as expected**.  The stories at the end of the lessons use only these words, to reinforce the learning of the patterns of the lesson. 

To the extent possible, the rules/generalizations that **Up the Ladder** is based on hold without exceptions. Any true exceptions are taught as "sight words" that need to be memorized, typically right after the pattern has been taught.
