## Teaching or Learning English
Learning English involves both learning to speak it and learning to read it.  This website is mostly about reading, and about teaching reading.

**UNDERSTAND + SPEAK = SPOKEN ENGLISH  
READ + WRITE = WRITTEN ENGLISH**

Learning written English (either learning to read or write it) is more difficult than learning to read/write most other European languages (details below).

English is a regular natural (human) language, and this means that children acquire spoken English to a large degree by the age of 3, as long as they hear English most of the time. Learning English later in life (after about age 7) is a bit more difficult -- but the process is the same as for any adult or teenager learning a new spoken language. There is nothing particularly challenging about spoken English.  

This is why it is difficult to learn to read English. English is an alphabetic language that has veered off from the alphabetic principle, especially when it comes to vowels. The idea of an alphabetic language is to combine symbols (letters) -- corresponding to individual sounds -- and thus be able to write all the words of the language in a systematic way, with very little memorizing.  However, through historical change and other incidents, English writing (spelling) has veered far from this ideal.  

The author of this website is a linguist, Anne Vainikka. I specialize in syntax, L1 (child) language acquisition and L2 (adult) language acquisition.  Written English is a new research topic for me.

This website represents a new analysis of English reading and spelling (writing). One of the new findings is that contrary to popular belief, English consonants are fairly regular -- if we exclude C and G, they are over 90% regular; for more details, download the consonant analysis.  

It is the vowels (`A E I O U`) where the real problems with English spelling emerge, making English one of the most difficult alphabetic languages to learn to read.

On this website a new teaching tool **UP THE LADDER** can be found that makes sense of English reading with the least amount of memorizing. Up the Ladder is designed to teach English literacy (reading) with a **minimum amount of learning**. The vocabulary in the **first 30 lessons is 98% regular**; that is, a solid basis for the mechanics of reading is established before having to memorize exceptions.

The trick is to organize what needs to be learned in such a way that nothing needs to be 'unlearned'! The product is based on phonics, but reading stories begins right away, **without having to memorize rules**. The phonics embedded in this product involves a new, extremely systematic way of conceptualizing English spelling generalizations. The product can be used for small groups in an ESL classroom, or **for self-teaching by an adult or a teenager**, on their own tablet, smartphone or laptop.  The **lessons are short and easy**, involving just watching and listening (and an occasional review exercise); learning can be completely self-paced.
