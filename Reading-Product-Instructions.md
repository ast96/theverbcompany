# Instructions

## Up the Ladder: Basic Instructions
- Do the lessons in order
- Two types of lessons:
  - Regular lessons - these lessons teach words first, and then have stories using only the words learned so far
  - Review lessons - these lessons have easy exercises
- Make sure the student can **read the stories** at the end of the lesson **before moving on** to the next lesson
- The 'title' at the top of the page (in brackets) shows what is being learned

## Regular Lessons
- Listen/watch the lesson 1-2 times first, letting the speaker do the work
- Listen/watch again while trying to imitate the speaker ("sounding out" the words), and trying to read the stories before the speaker says the sentence (1-2 times or more)
- Turn the sound off and try to do what the speaker did through the lesson
- Each regular lesson contains `The List` (exceptional words that have to be memorized), new words with a picture (broken down into sounds), and 5 stories that only use the word types already learned

## Review Lessons
- **Review/exercise lessons** occur after 3-4 regular lessons; they cover the previous lessons
- Contain a picture and two words
- The student will read both words and choose which one goes with the picture
- The correct answer is on the next page
